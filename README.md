# Pixie - A Tiny Adventure in Assembly!

Welcome to **Pixie**, a simple yet magical gmae written in **x64 assembly (FASM)** using the raw pixel-shooting power of **Raylib** and the blood, sweat and tears of my remining neurons!

This is not just a game. It's a cry for help.
It's a rebellion against modern software bloat.

![Demo](assets/demo.gif)

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- Linux (x86_64)
- [FASM](https://flatassembler.net/) - because who needs sanity
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) - one of the few C libs that didn't gaslight me (yet)
- `ld` (GNU linker)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- `make` - it builds things. Sometimes.
- A strong will to live (optional, but recommended)

=======
- `make` - cause I like to pretend things are automated
- optional: a therapist (for debug trauma)
>>>>>>> origin/main
---

### Build & Run
Clone the repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/0xFA99/Pixie.git
$ cd Pixie
$ make
$ ./Pixie
```
> **Warning:** running this may cause your CPU to feel disrespected and overachive out of fear.
To clean up:
```sh
$ make clean
```

## Warning
This project was written in FASM, with zero safety nets, training wheels or regrets.

- understanding this code may unlock ancient knowledge or possibly just migrains
